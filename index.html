        <h1>Project Stardust</h1>

        Project Stardust, also known as the Death Star project, was the project that saw the construction<br> 
        of the superweapon known as the first Death Star, enforced by the Galactic Empire.<br><br>
        Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, the Rebel Alliance stole the Death Star plans, <br>
        with the efforts of Rogue One. The plans were themselves code-named Stardust, allowing Jyn Erso<br>
        to recognize them on Scarif, as <b>"Stardust"</b> had been her father Galen's nickname for her. <br><br>


        Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, is a big movie
